# Zabbx-and-ServerSpec

To Run this, ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured locally on your machine.

You will need to update the parameters in the DeployNested.sh script with the S3 buckets you want to upload your artifacts to.  

Just make sure you then use these same S3 bucket/key names in the paramsNested.json where your Quickstart Files and ServerSpec tests will reside.

Lastly make sure you update the paramsNested.json file with the require parameters needed to deploy this template.

Fianlly execute from the bin directory:  ./DeployNested.sh script.
